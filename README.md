# startup_name_generator

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started


Used the following resource as a guide to my first Flutter project 
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)


This creates a list of potential startup names by combining two randomized-English words. 
You are able to select your favorites and view them as a separate list.
